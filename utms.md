Our app automatically saves a cookie with Google utm parameters on a last-click basis and passes to the appropriate vendor as __Custom Properties__ or __Tags__ with your request. Utms are prefixed with `apihelper_` and come through like: `apihelper_utm_source: 'Some source'`.

We store the following utm fields:
* `utm_source`
* `utm_medium`
* `utm_campaign`
* `utm_label`
